## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
The purpose of the analysis was to use a dataset of lending activity from a peer-to-peer 
lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The financial information that the data was based on is historical loan data. We need to create a model and determine the creditworthiness of borrowers loans. 
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
We used the 'value_counts' function to determine what loans were either 'risky' and 'normal'
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.

* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
Accuracy: 0.99
Precision: 0.86
Recall: 0.91


* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
Accuracy: 0.99
Precision: 0.99
Recall: 0.99

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
